### Tools & Technical Guidance ###
This project was developed through iterative modeling and simulation using Python-based surface evaluators, option chain mockups, and confidence scoring logic. Special attention was given to trajectory feasibility, penalty optimization, and risk-aware decision gates for PMCC strategy execution.

Assisted Design
Significant design and implementation support was provided by:

Model design and technical assistance supported by OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT.
Exploratory modeling, scoring logic, and trajectory framework co-developed through iterative dialogue and refinement.

Tools Used
Python 3.10+

NumPy (surface and score grid generation)

Matplotlib (visual debugging; optional)

Simulated options chain and surface topologies

Logic-driven gating and dynamic scoring models

### Still Left to Do ###
What Remains, maybe 50% reached so far:

Multi-week trajectory pathfinder tuning

Frustum drift behavior (e.g., market skew over time)

Real data pipeline integration (or live chain ingestion)

Confidence evolution across path

Live bin tracking + diagnostics UI

Backtest harness and result logging

Failover logic for high-VIX/supernova conditions

Deployment automation or GUI layer (optional)

Overall, we're about halfway through a functioning PMCC selector and navigator.
Core logic, scoring, confidence gating, and structural modeling are complete.
Next phase involves real-world data integration, trajectory fine-tuning, and interface layers.
