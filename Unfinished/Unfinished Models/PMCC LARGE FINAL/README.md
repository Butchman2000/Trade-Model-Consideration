Tools & Technical Guidance
This project was developed through iterative modeling and simulation using Python-based surface evaluators, option chain mockups, and confidence scoring logic. Special attention was given to trajectory feasibility, penalty optimization, and risk-aware decision gates for PMCC strategy execution.

Assisted Design
Significant design and implementation support was provided by:

Model design and technical assistance supported by OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT.
Exploratory modeling, scoring logic, and trajectory framework co-developed through iterative dialogue and refinement.

Tools Used
Python 3.10+

NumPy (surface and score grid generation)

Matplotlib (visual debugging; optional)

Simulated options chain and surface topologies

Logic-driven gating and dynamic scoring models
