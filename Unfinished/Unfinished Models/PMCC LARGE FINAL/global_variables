# PURPOSE
"""
This script lays out a framework for evaluating PMCC (Poor Man's Covered Call) trajectory models
using simplified constraints and parameter inputs. The structure is designed for clarity and brute-force
experimentation. It avoids Python shortcuts and emphasizes transparency and annotation to support
conceptual understanding for those newer to the language.

# This is where future logic will be written:
# - Evaluation of current market conditions
# - Calculation of frustum window based on VIX
# - Assessment of trajectory feasibility from short to long leg
# - Estimation of correction burns needed, if any
# - Decision to proceed, adjust, or abandon

# EXAMPLE STRUCTURE (future refactor):
# def evaluate_pmcc_path(...):
#     # Perform calculations and decision-making here
#     return outcome, diagnostics

# ----------------------
# NOTES
# ----------------------
# - Every numeric parameter above can be looped over later for brute-force search
# - Python structures kept verbose and instructional
# - Ideal for experimentation, later optimization, and visual feedback integration
