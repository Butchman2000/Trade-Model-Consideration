# TRAJECTORY PLANNING FRAMEWORK - PMCC ORBITAL NAVIGATION

"""
This document outlines the core modeling philosophy behind probabilistic PMCC optimization,
framed as a navigational system for capital-efficient option trading. It borrows concepts from
orbital mechanics, trajectory correction maneuvers, and predictive market topology.

# ---- CORE CONCEPTS ----

# 1. SURFACE TIERS
# Tier 1: Week 1 (short call entry)
# - Full-resolution surface
# - Modeled with high granularity (strike × IV grid)
# - Critical launch vector selection

# Tier 2: Midcourse Weeks (e.g., Week 2, 3, 4)
# - Simplified penalty surfaces using frustum approximations
# - Movable flat-top window (optimal zone)
# - Sloped perimeter to model deviation risk
# - Optional: bloom zones (non-adjacent low-penalty tiles)

# Tier 3: Arrival Week (LEAP leg)
# - May use frustum, possibly smoothed or expanded
# - Destination alignment zone (must intersect trajectory)
# - Minor corrective power remaining (burns expensive)


# 2. BURN ZONE CLASSIFICATION
# - Soft Pass: No adjustment needed, minimal angle change
# - Curve Correction: Minor burn to stay on arc
# - Sharp Angle: Must burn — high curvature, skew, or IV shift
# - Fuel Forward: Reserve delta/vega or capital to enable future adjustment
#   - Recommend budgeting fuel forward by 1.1× of DFED (Deterministic Forward Expected Distribution) predicted shift
#   - Accounts for Black-Scholes limitations under stochastic volatility
#   - Allows 'pre-loading' Earth for adjustment if trajectory through intermediate weeks becomes unstable
# - Supernova Events:
#   - When market-wide volatility (e.g., VIX > 90) spikes to extreme levels, the normal rules of navigation collapse
#   - Expect gravitational warping of trajectory — surface topology becomes unpredictable
#   - Post-spike IV collapse (e.g., -33% in an hour) can create nonlinear price expansions
#   - These are not tradable in standard PMCC flight plans
#   - Require emergency vectoring or rapid withdrawal — navigational fabric becomes distorted
#   - Model should trigger Command Center alert for abandonment conditions if IV asymmetry develops:
#     - Short-call IV collapsing far faster than long-call IV
#     - Extreme divergence in delta behavior across expiration layers
#     - Sudden loss of resolution in forward surfaces (frustums invalidated)
#   - Frustum window may exhibit compounded lensing effect:
#     - Earth-target (profit zone) appears to shrink rapidly as VIX increases
#     - Apparent destination may warp or recede
#     - Model must account for perceived reduction in achievable alignment when VIX crosses stress thresholds
#
# - VIX-Driven Frustum Rules:
#   - VIX ≤ 24: Flat-top window is wide, penalties light — "Easy Going"
#   - 24 < VIX ≤ 28: Window contracts moderately, slope increases — "Hmm..."
#   - 28 < VIX ≤ 32: Narrow path, elevated burn risk — "Caution"
#   - 32 < VIX ≤ 36: Critical tight angle only — "Warning"
#   - 36 < VIX ≤ 40: Minimal viable window, prepare escape path — "WATCH OUT"
#   - VIX > 40: Auto-abandon — trajectory irrecoverable under frustum logic


# 3. STRATEGIC ELEMENTS
# - Entry surface sets vector (Week 1 delta = critical)
# - Midweeks shift the cone of success (window moves inward)
# - Frustum centers reflect this drift (Week 1 edge → Week 2 middle)
# - Watch for non-linear skew events (IV twist = unexpected slope)


# 4. MODEL EXTENSIONS
# - Cost overlays for burns (theta loss, bid-ask spread)
# - Probabilistic path ensembles (Monte Carlo through penalty layers)
# - Visual arc mapping (like Apollo navigation lines through distorted fields)


# 5. OUTCOME
# - Final PMCC intercepts the LEAP zone with minimal drift
# - Corrected if necessary, but ideally inertial
# - Fuel preserved, capital efficient, risk-transparent


# ---- ADDITIONAL FRAMEWORK LAYERS ----

# A. SURFACE UNCERTAINTY NOTATION
# - Capture uncertain IV/skew/volume inputs using 'fog index' or variance overlay
# - Grid cells with high uncertainty gain shaded opacity or stochastically varying penalty weights
# - Evaluator may skip unstable regions or assign lower confidence multipliers
# - Useful during low liquidity or when earnings events approach

# B. FRUSTUM DRIFT INDEX
# - Define center drift across week-layers (e.g., center_x += drift_per_week)
# - Allow center to migrate due to macro or micro changes
# - Keep log of weekly drift deltas — useful for tracking persistent skew
# - May require recalibration of burn timing if midcourse corrections shift too late

# C. MULTI-ROUTE ANALYSIS
# - Detect when more than one viable arc exists from origin to Earth
# - Score each route using total penalty and variance sensitivity
# - May trigger branching planner (parallel strategy)
# - Archive and rank historical route structures for pattern recognition

# D. CONFIDENCE MODEL INTEGRATION
# - Normalize path penalty into surface_score (0.0 to 1.0)
# - Feed surface_score into bin confidence calculation
# - If score drops below 0.65, reduce allocation or halt PMCC entry
# - Link surface_score weight to history_success and IV stability
# - Allows dynamic confidence reflex across regime changes
