Rules for change control mechanics.

To be incorporated into one or more SOPs.

Code mechanics are to be improved as understanding of entry selections are standardized and limited.

Commit comments are to be full sentences, in the tense that represents what has happened, with default as past tense.
If more than one action has been performed, no matter how small, it must be explained.
To explain, if a single deletion is made, use 'Deletion {small / large}'
For example, for small, if a space, or an empty line, or one line, or one line of notes, is deleted.
All other deletion activity is to be proclaimed as large.

If a single appended or added material is made, 'Addition {small / large}'
For example, for small, from a single letter or space,
up to one full line, or one line of notes.
All other adding activity is to be proclaimed as large.

Then, in one sentence or more, but no more than three sentences, describe the change that was made.

Then, in one sentence, up to three sentences, describe the impact that was made.

Then, in one sentence, up to three sentences, describe the future risk of the change.

This is to be cumulatively analyzed by the role of quality assurance trained person, and subsequent permission
is to be requested before full incorporation of the code.

Depending on the severity of the impact, alternative documentation is necessary.

Depending on the severity of the risk, alternative documenation is necessary, including a CAPA.
