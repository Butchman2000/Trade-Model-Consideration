# Program: ibkr_governance_compliance_oversight
# Author: Brian Anderson
# Origin Date: 06May2025
# Version: 1.0
#
# Purpose:
#    /Structured outline for governance, compliance, and model oversight
#    /This file defines stubs and placeholders for a complete governance model
#    /including account health tracking, market sentiment interpretation,
#    /model control zones, and operational risk monitoring.

"""
Submain_market_evaluation
--------------------------
- Fear/Greed Index (pull from API or scrape source like CNN)
- Market sentiment score (combined from VIX, volume, news)
- Sentiment trend (e.g. today vs yesterday)
- Optional: volatility burst warnings, sector-specific behavior

Submain_account_health
----------------------
- Account Start-of-Day snapshot
- Red flags from yesterday
- Critical actions needed today (warnings, expiries)
- Permitted loss thresholds (daily % and $)
- Rough spread/condor/etc. inventory breakdown
- Bin analysis: % of portfolio in high-risk structures
- Estimated threat level: low, med, high

Submain_audit_compliance
------------------------
- Unresolved investigations and initiation date
- Open CAPAs (Corrective Actions / Preventive Actions)
- Change controls pending (with due dates)

Submain_controls_state
----------------------
- Current control level: observation / alert / override
- Mode map: yellow / orange / red
- Current violations: spread mismatches, size rules, exposure caps
