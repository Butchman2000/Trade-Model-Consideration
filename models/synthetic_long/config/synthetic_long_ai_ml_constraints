Context:
As the synthetic model reaches maturity, AI/ML/NN integration becomes the next frontier.
To enable learning without loss of interpretability or control, we must define:

1. Local Constraint Space:
   - Inputs that AI/ML models can directly see or optimize over:
     * IV level
     * IV swing count (normalized per hour)
     * Volume disjunction count
     * Time-of-day bucket (e.g. pre-10:00, midday, post-2:30)
     * Flag severity (yellow/orange/red)
     * Most recent decay weight

2. Global Constraints (non-negotiable limits):
   - Max open synthetics
   - Max IV exposure
   - Max daily synthetic risk loss
   - Stop sign triggers from flag system (e.g. red flag = full halt)
   - Historical synthetic loss gates (prior-day shutdown thresholds)

3. Exploration Space Definition:
   - Permissible tunable ranges for AI/ML testing:
     * min_edge_threshold: [0.25, 0.75]
     * delay_entry_minutes: [5, 30]
     * max_synthetics_allowed: [1, 10]
     * trade_timing_weighting: [0.0, 1.0]
     * flag_penalty_multiplier: [0.0, 2.5]

4. Sequencing Strategy:
   - Train and evaluate components in the following stages:
     Stage 1: IV-only regime scoring (classify vs pass)
     Stage 2: Add volume behavior and flag history
     Stage 3: Include time-of-day and macro filters
     Stage 4: Explore predictive models for synthetic profitability ranking

5. Logging and Oversight:
   - All ML decisions must be logged to JSON with:
     * timestamp
     * input state
     * decision rationale
     * override status (manual or triggered)
   - All learned decisions must be replayable and reversibly auditable
